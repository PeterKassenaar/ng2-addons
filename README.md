# ng2 Add ons

A collective list of 3rd party add-ons for Angular 2-development (directives, components, filters, etc.)

> This list does *not* include libraries, components etc, already in development, or endorsed by team Angular itself, such as Angular Material, Angular Mobile, Angular CLI, Ionic 2, Meteor 2, etc. It will list only 'real' third party solutions. 
   Pull requests very much accepted.
